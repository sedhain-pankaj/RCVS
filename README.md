# Extract RCVS Website Data

This Python script is used to extract data from the RCVS (Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons) <a href="https://findavet.rcvs.org.uk/find-a-vet-practice/?filter-choice=name&filter-keyword=&filter-searchtype=practice&filter-pss=true&p=1" target="_blank">website</a>. It retrieves information about veterinary practices, including the clinic ID, name, website URL, address, and phone number in UK.

## How to Run

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine. You can download Python from the <a href="https://www.python.org/downloads/" target="_blank">Python's official website</a>.

2. Install the required Python libraries by running the following command in your terminal:

```bash
pip install requests beautifulsoup4
```

3. Run the script by typing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python extract_rcvs.py
```

## User Prompts

When you run the script, it will ask you for the following inputs:

- `Start page`: The page number to start collecting data from.
- `End page`: The page number to stop collecting data at.
- `Save to CSV`: Press `y` if you want to save the data to a CSV. You will be prompted to enter the name of the CSV file. It will ask for overwrite confirmation if the file already exists.

## Demo

### You can save the data to a CSV file or just view it in terminal

### The CSV file will be saved in the same directory as the script

## Data

The script retrieves the following data for each veterinary practice:

- `Clinic ID`: A unique identifier for the clinic, based on the page number and the order of the clinic on the page.
- `Name`: The name of the clinic.
- `Website URL`: The URL of the clinic's website.
- `Address`: The address of the clinic.
- `Phone`: The phone number of the clinic.
- `Email`: RCVS uses some sort of email obfuscation, so the email can't be retrieved.

The data can be viewed in terminal and saved to a CSV file, depending on your input.

## Utils Folder

The `utils` folder contains helper Python scripts that are used by the main script `extract_rcvs.py`. Here's a brief description of each file:

- `constants.py`: This file defines several constants used throughout the project, such as the base URL for the RCVS website, the details to be extracted for each clinic and how many times to retry the request if it fails.

- `pages_to_parse.py`: This script contains functions to handle user input for the start and end pages to collect the data from.

- `parse_clinics_details.py`: This script contains functions to parse the details of each clinic from the HTML of the webpage. It includes functions to get the clinic ID, name, website URL, address, and phone number.

- `save_to_csv.py`: This script contains functions to save the extracted data to a CSV file. It includes functions to ask the user for confirmation to save or overwrite (if the file already exists) to a CSV file.

The `__pycache__` directory is automatically generated by Python. It contains compiled Python bytecode files which load faster than the original scripts. You can safely ignore this directory.
